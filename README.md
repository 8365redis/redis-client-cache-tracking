## Build

After preparing the build environment just run : 

```
make
```

Or if you want the Debug version which has lots of logs to standard output (don't run heavy stress tests) you can use: 

```
make DEBUG=1
```

## Load

To load the development module you can use these commands: 

```
redis-server --loadmodule ./bin/cct.so
```

or 

```
make load
```

## Test
Development is done by `Python 3.10.2` but any version after `3.6.X` should be fine. To install needed python packages just run (generated by `pipreqs`): 

```
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

For test purposes you can use the python client. To run the tests just run : 

```
make test
```

or only run performance tests: 

```
make perf_test
```

* `CCT.REGISTER`
* `CCT.FT.SEARCH`
